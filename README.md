# Marker Based AR App 🎯

This project is a **Marker-Based Augmented Reality (AR) App** developed in **Unity** as part of the [Unity Learn Mobile AR Development Pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/mobile-ar-development/unit/create-a-marker-based-ar-app/tutorial/66f45d90edbc2a0a294923ce).
It was my first hands-on experience building AR applications, and it helped me explore how digital 3D objects can be placed in the real world using markers.

## 📌 Features

* Detects and tracks a **marker image** through the device camera.
* Displays and anchors **3D objects** on top of the detected marker.
* Real-time tracking: the virtual object follows the marker when it moves.
* Built with **Unity 2023 LTS** and **AR Foundation**.
* Supports **ARCore** (Android) and **ARKit** (iOS).
